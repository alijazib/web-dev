Learning github and web developement side by side
I created this repo to basically learn basics of github,while making a website in html5 and css3.
Just for curious people how to run this app.
Step 1:
Download everything to a folder.
Step 2:run index.html
Note:
Keep index.html and style.css in same folder as well as keep css,fonts and img folders also in the same folder.

Happy web developement!
