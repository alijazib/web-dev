Learning github and web developement side by side
I created this repo to basically learn basics of github,while making a website in html5 and css3.
Just for curious people how to run this app.<br />
Step 1:<br />
Download everything to a folder.<br />
Step 2:run index.html<br />
Note:<br />
Keep index.html and style.css in same folder as well as keep css,fonts and img folders also in the same folder.<br />
<br />
Happy web developement!<br />
